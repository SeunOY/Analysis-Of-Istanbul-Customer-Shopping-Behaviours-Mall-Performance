Analysis Of Istanbul Customer Shopping Behaviours & Mall Performance


To understand how customer demographics like gender, and generation affect buying behaviours across malls in Istanbul, the Istanbul dataset from Kaggle was analysed using SQL, Excel and visualised with Tableau.

The data was first cleaned in Excel to ensure there were no duplicates and blank fields and to ensure consistent values after which it was loaded to the DB browser for SQL queries.

The SQL queries below were run to populate data on:


Total Gender Split Across All Malls




Number of Transactions Generated In Each Mall





Revenue Generated In Each Mall





Customer Age Distribution Across All Malls




Product Quantity Sold Across All Malls



 Revenue Split By Age, product category, gender & Mall



The data generated from the SQL queries were saved in Excel formats to and uploaded to Tableau to be transformed into visual data, a preview for the dashboard can be seen below.
